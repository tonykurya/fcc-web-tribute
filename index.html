                                      <h3>Da Vinci’s Inventions</h3>
                                      <h4>Anemometer</h4>
                                  <p>Historians stipulate that it was Leonardo da Vinci’s fascination with flight that inspired him to innovate the anemometer, an instrument for measuring the speed of wind.</p>
                                  <h4>Flying Machine</h4>
                                  <p>Of Leonardo da Vinci’s many areas of study, perhaps this Renaissance man’s favorite was the area of aviation. It was this interest that inspired his most famous invention – the flying machine.</p>
                                  <h4>Helicopter(Aerial Screw)</h4>
                                  <p>Though the first actual helicopter wasn’t built until the 1940s, it is believed that Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches from the late fifteenth century detailed a predecessor to the modern-day flying machine.</p>
                                  <h4>Parachute</h4>
                                  <p>Though credit for the invention of the first practical parachute usually goes to Sebastien Lenormand in 1783, Leonardo da Vinci actually conceived the parachute idea a few hundred years earlier.</p>
                                  <h4>33-Barelled organ</h4>
                                  <p>The way Leonardo da Vinci saw it, the problem with canons of the time was that they took far too long to load. His solution was to build multi-barreled guns that could be loaded and fired simultaneously.</p>
                                  <h4>Armoured Car</h4>
                                  <p>The precursor to the modern tank, Leonardo da Vinci's armored car invention was capable of moving in any direction and was equipped with a large number of weapons.</p>
                                  <h4>Giant Crossbow</h4>
                                  <p>One thing Leonardo da Vinci may have understood better than any of his contemporaries was the psychological effects of weapons in warfare – as illustrated by his giant crossbow invention.</p>
                                  <h4>Triple Barrel Canon</h4>
                                  <p>As a military engineer, one of Leonardo da Vinci's key beliefs was that mobility was crucial to victory on the battlefield. This idea is seen in his triple barrel canon invention.</p>
                                  <h4>Clock</h4>
                                  <p>To put away any initial confusion: Leonardo da Vinci did not invent the clock. What he did was design a more accurate clock.</p>
                                      <h4>Collosus</h4>
                                      <p>Perhaps even more interesting than the ambition and innovation behind Leonardo da Vinci's Colossus invention is the dramatic and heartbreaking story of his attempts to bring it to life.</p>
                                      <h4>Ideal City</h4>
                                      <p>No idea speaks to the epic ambition and scope of Leonardo da Vinci's inventions better than his ideal city, which combines da Vinci's talents as an artist, architect, engineer and inventor</p>
                                      <h4>Robotic Knight</h4>
                                      <p>With his innovative, engineering mind, Leonardo da Vinci had many ideas that employed the use of pulleys, weights and gears – including his invention of a fully animated robot.</p>
                                      <h4>Self-Propelled Cart</h4>
                                      <p>Before motorized vehicles were even a glimmer in someone's eye, Leonardo da Vinci designed a self-propelled cart capable of moving without being pushed.</p>
                                      <h4>Scuba Gear</h4>
                                      <p>In his lifetime, da Vinci designed many inventions dealing with water – perhaps, most notably, scuba gear.</p>
                                      <h4>Revolving Bridge</h4>
                                      <p>Designed for Duke Sforza, Leonardo da Vinci's revolving bridge could be quickly packed up and transported for use by armies on the move to pass over bodies of water.</p>
